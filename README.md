# todo-list-app

## What it's about

I made a To-Do list web app where you can add, remove, and update custom lists of your own. This app uses a MongoDB database that's locally stored (might have to configure it for your personal use), but I plan to integrate a cloud-stored database soon (version uploaded here won't have my credentials obviously).

## Tech Stack Used

I made this using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB

## Where I Learned To Make This

I took a Udemy course on full-stack web development (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) and adapted the last to-do list lesson to my liking. Starter code was taken from the course resources section (https://www.appbrewery.co/p/web-development-course-resources/)
